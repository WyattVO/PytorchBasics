# 🧮 PyTorch Basics: Feedforward Neural Network on MNIST

“Implemented and trained a feedforward neural network on MNIST using PyTorch.”

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to build and train a **fully connected neural network (FCNN)** using **PyTorch** on the **MNIST dataset** — a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits (0–9).

The goal is to classify digits with high accuracy using only simple layers (`Linear` + `ReLU`), providing an intuitive introduction to neural network training.
